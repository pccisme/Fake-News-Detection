# Fake-News-Detection

INF385T: INTRO TO MACHINE LEARNING (27655)

### Description

Detecting fake news has become one of the biggest issues in the world. There are already a lot of researches in this area. However, most of the previous research focused on the news content and ignored the importance of the headline. Also, with dierent research emerged, researchers are seeking for better features to build up more accurate models. Our research applied the newly built [LIAR dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00648), with two algorithms, KNN and the neuron network to try to build a better detection model. In addition, we also tested dierent feature combinations in this research to gure out the determining features in the LIAR dataset.

### Video

Here a [video](https://youtu.be/OP7ROjHbQLA) on Youtube to talk about the project.

### Installation

The codes are built on Google Colab. Please downlaod the dataset from [LIAR dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00648) first. Then, with the codes in this repository, anyone should be able to run the result. If you have any issue, welcome to contact me.

### Authors and acknowledgment

Thank to my partner, Wayne (Chun-Wei) Wang. We worked on this project together, and it was quite a good old days for me. Also, thank to the fantastic instuctor Prof. Gurari, who always supports our idea and encourage us to give it a try! Last but not least, thank to Dr. [William Yang Wang](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Wang%2C+W+Y), who built LIAR dataset.
